It was developed by Cal Poly's Digital Transformation Hub for use by the World Bank. It borrows some code and concepts from the [VegMapper repo](https://github.com/NaiaraSPinto/VegMapper). Further inspiration and ideas were taken from Andrew Fricker and Jonathan Ventura of Cal Poly, Naiara Pinto of JPL, and Matt Hansen and Amy Pickens of the University of Maryland.
